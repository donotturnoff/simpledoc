# simpledoc
A simple hypertext document retrieval system.

Depends on [lr0](https://donotturnoff.net/projects/lr0/) for parsing.
Download the [library JAR file](https://donotturnoff.net/projects/lr0/lr0.jar) and include it as a library
by passing its path to the `-cp` argument of `javac`.
I will streamline this in the future. In the meantime, you can download a complete functioning system from
[this project's webpage](https://donotturnoff.net/projects/simpledoc/)
